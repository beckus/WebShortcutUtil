{"name":"Web Shortcut Utility Suite","tagline":"Utilities for working with .url, .website, .desktop, and .webloc files","body":"# Overview\r\nThis is a suite of applications and libraries for working with web shortcuts. Web shortcuts are the files that are created by various operating systems when you save a link to a website.  These utilities support shortcuts for Windows, Linux, and Apple.  Specifically, these are files with the following extensions: .url, .website, .desktop, .webloc.\r\n\r\n# Applications\r\n- [PC Application](https://github.com/abcodeworks/WebShortcut-PC/wiki)\r\n  <p>Allows you to launch shortcuts (currently supports Windows and Linux).</p>\r\n- [Android App](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.abcodeworks.webshortcutapp)\r\n  <p>An Android app that allows you to launch and create shortcuts on Android devices.</p>\r\n- [Website](http://abcodeworks.com/WebShortcut)\r\n  <p>Allows you to launch and convert shortcuts from within a web browser.</p>\r\n\r\n# Libraries\r\n- [Java library](https://github.com/abcodeworks/WebShortcutUtil-Java/)\r\n  <p>Provides classes/methods for reading and writing shortcuts.</p>\r\n- [Perl Library](http://search.cpan.org/~beckus/WebShortcutUtil/)\r\n  <p>Provides routines for reading and writing shortcuts.</p>\r\n- [Shortcut Samples](https://github.com/beckus/WebShortcutSamples/)\r\n  <p>During development I collected shortcuts from various operating systems (both to study and to use for\r\n  unit tests).  I also manually created some examples for testing purposes.  I made these available in their\r\n  own repository with the hope that they will be useful to other developers.</p>\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nI have found myself using various operating systems over the years, and I have also increasingly used cloud file services.  I sometimes work in one operating system, create a shortcut, put the shortcut on a cloud service, then try to open the shortcut in another operating system.  This generally does not work.\r\nThere are workarounds such as opening the shortcuts with a text editor and copying the URL, or using link services such as Delicious.\r\n\r\nI decided to try and create a set of applications and libraries that would allow you to open any shortcut regardless of which operating system you are using.  I don't find this subject particularly exciting, so I was initially hesitant to start a new project.  However, I wanted to gain experience using various programming languages, installers, etc., and This project seemed ideal due to its small size.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of improvements that could be made to these utilities.\r\nUnfortunately, this is a low priority for me, and I don't have specific plans to develop them any further.\r\nIf you find the utilities useful and would like to see them improved, please\r\n<a href=\"http://abeckus.com/contact.html\">let me know</a> (I guess if you hate them you can let me know too).\r\n\r\n# Author\r\nAndre Beckus (@beckus)","google":"UA-50803151-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
