{"name":"WebShortcutUtil","tagline":"Web Shortcut Utility Suite","body":"### Overview\r\nThis is a suite of libraries and tools for working with web shortcuts.\r\nWeb shortcuts are the files that are created by various operating systems when you save\r\na link to a website.\r\n\r\nI have found myself using various operating systems over the years, and I also\r\nhave been increasingly using cloud file services.  I sometimes work in one\r\noperating system, create a shortcut, put the shortcut on a cloud service, then try\r\nto open the shortcut in another operating system.  This generally does not work.\r\nThere are workarounds such as opening the shortcuts with a text editor and copying the\r\nURL, or using link services such as Delicious.\r\n\r\nI decided to try and create a set of applications and libraries that would allow you to\r\nopen any shortcut regardless of which operating system you are using.  A major goal was\r\nto gain experience using various programming languages, installers, etc., and this project\r\nseemed ideal, since the libraries/applications would be fairly small.\r\nI originally intended to create installable applications for Windows, Linux, and maybe Apple, \r\nbut never did.  There is a lot of room for improvement, but I no longer will have the time.\r\n\r\nThe functionality is as follows:\r\n- Be able to retrieve the name and URL of Windows, Linux, and Apple\r\n  shortcuts.  Specifically these are files with the following extensions:\r\n  .url, .website, .desktop, .webloc.\r\n- Be able to create shortcut files given a name and URL.\r\n- More details can be found in the library documentation.\r\n\r\nBelow you will find a list of the applications/libraries.\r\n\r\n### Launcher for PCs\r\nThis is a command line Java application that allows you to launch shortcuts on your PC.\r\nUnfortunately, due to differences in operating systems, it is difficult\r\nto open a browser reliably in Java.  Therefore, this application will not\r\nwork on all operating systems or distributions.\r\n\r\nThis Java application could be packaged into installers for the various\r\noperating systems, but I have no plans to do so.\r\nInstead, I have a wiki page with manual installation instructions, which\r\nare unfortunately cumbersome and incomplete.\r\n\r\n- Installation wiki page: https://github.com/abcodeworks/LaunchWebShortcut-Java/wiki/Installing/\r\n- Source code: https://github.com/abcodeworks/LaunchWebShortcut-Java/\r\n\r\n### Android App\r\nThis is an Android app that allows you to launch and create shortcuts.\r\n\r\n- Android Marketplace Page: \r\n- Source code: https://github.com/abcodeworks/WebShortcut-Android/\r\n\r\n### Java Library\r\nThis library has been tested on Android and\r\nappears to be completely compatible. The functionality and implementation\r\nis largely equivalent to the Java library.\r\n\r\n- Source code: https://github.com/abcodeworks/WebShortcutUtil-Java/\r\n- Maven Repository: \r\n- Javadocs:  http://abcodeworks.github.io/WebShortcutUtil-Java/javadoc/latest/\r\n\r\n### Perl Library\r\nThis is a PERL library.  The functionality and implementation\r\nis largely equivalent to the Java library.\r\n\r\n- Source code: https://github.com/beckus/WebShortcutUtil-Perl/\r\n- CPAN module: http://search.cpan.org/~beckus/WebShortcutUtil/\r\n\r\n### Samples\r\nDuring development I collected a set of shortcuts from\r\nvarious operating systems (both to study and to use for\r\nunit tests).  I made these available in their own repository.\r\n\r\n- Repository: https://github.com/beckus/WebShortcutSamples/\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nAndre Beckus (@beckus)","google":"UA-50803151-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
