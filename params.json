{"name":"WebShortcutUtil","tagline":"Web Shortcut Utility Suite","body":"# Overview\r\nThis is a suite of libraries and tools for working with web shortcuts. Web shortcuts are the files that are created by various operating systems when you save a link to a website.\r\n\r\nI have found myself using various operating systems over the years, and I have also increasingly used cloud file services.  I sometimes work in one operating system, create a shortcut, put the shortcut on a cloud service, then try to open the shortcut in another operating system.  This generally does not work.\r\nThere are workarounds such as opening the shortcuts with a text editor and copying the URL, or using link services such as Delicious.\r\n\r\nI decided to try and create a set of applications and libraries that would allow you to open any shortcut regardless of which operating system you are using.  Although I don't find this subject particularly exciting, I thought it would be a good way to gain experience using various programming languages, installers, etc..  This project seemed ideal, since the libraries/applications would be fairly small. I originally intended to create installable applications for Windows, Linux, and maybe Apple, but never did.  There is a lot of room for improvement, but I no longer will have the time.\r\n\r\nThe functionality is as follows:\r\n- Be able to retrieve the name and URL of Windows, Linux, and Apple\r\n  shortcuts.  Specifically these are files with the following extensions:\r\n  .url, .website, .desktop, .webloc.\r\n- Be able to create shortcut files given a name and URL.\r\n- More details can be found in the library documentation.\r\n\r\nBelow you will find a list of the applications/libraries.\r\n\r\n# Launcher for PCs\r\nThis is a command line Java application that allows you to launch shortcuts on your PC.  Unfortunately, due to differences in operating systems, it is difficult to open a browser reliably in Java.  Therefore, this application will not work on all operating systems or distributions.\r\n\r\nThis Java application could be packaged into installers for the various operating systems, but I have no plans to do so. Instead, I have a wiki page with manual installation instructions, which\r\nare unfortunately cumbersome and incomplete.\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n- The launcher does not work on some operating systems, for example Solaris.\r\n- The launcher only works on Linux distributions that have the \"xdg-open\" command installed.\r\n- The launcher does not appear to work on Windows with files with unicode characters (it gives\r\n  a \"file not found\" error).\r\n\r\nLinks:\r\n- Latest JAR file: https://github.com/abcodeworks/LaunchWebShortcut-Java/releases/latest/\r\n- Installation wiki page: https://github.com/abcodeworks/LaunchWebShortcut-Java/wiki/Installing/\r\n- Source code: https://github.com/abcodeworks/LaunchWebShortcut-Java/\r\n\r\n# Android App\r\nThis is an Android app that allows you to launch and create shortcuts.\r\n\r\nLinks:\r\n- Android Marketplace Page: http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.abcodeworks.webshortcutapp\r\n- Source code: https://github.com/abcodeworks/WebShortcut-Android/\r\n\r\n# Java Library\r\nA Java library intended for use in other Java applications.  It provides classes/methods for reading and writing shortcuts.  This library has been tested on Android and appears to be completely compatible. The functionality and implementation is largely equivalent to the Perl library.\r\n\r\nThe library is published to the Maven repository.

I also manually created some examples for testing purposes.  I made these available in their own repository with the hope that they will be useful to other developers.\r\n\r\nLinks:\r\n- Repository: https://github.com/beckus/WebShortcutSamples/\r\n\r\n# Author\r\nAndre Beckus (@beckus)","google":"UA-50803151-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
