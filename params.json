{"name":"WebShortcutUtil","tagline":"Web Shortcut Utility Suite","body":"# Overview\r\nThis is a suite of libraries and tools for working with web shortcuts. Web shortcuts are the files that are created by various operating systems when you save a link to a website.\r\n\r\nI have found myself using various operating systems over the years, and I have also increasingly used cloud file services.  I sometimes work in one operating system, create a shortcut, put the shortcut on a cloud service, then try to open the shortcut in another operating system.  This generally does not work.\r\nThere are workarounds such as opening the shortcuts with a text editor and copying the URL, or using link services such as Delicious.\r\n\r\nI decided to try and create a set of applications and libraries that would allow you to open any shortcut regardless of which operating system you are using.  I don't find this subject particularly exciting, so I was initially hesitant to start a new project.  However, I wanted to gain experience using various programming languages, installers, etc., and This project seemed ideal due to its small size.\r\n\r\n## Functionality\r\n- Supports shortcut files for Windows, Linux, and Apple.  Specifically, these are files with the following extensions: .url, .website, .desktop, .webloc.\r\n- Retrieves the name and URL from shortcut files.\r\n- Creates shortcut files given a name and URL.\r\n- More details can be found in the library documentation.\r\n\r\n# Applications and Libraries\r\n\r\n## Java Launcher for PCs\r\nA command line Java application that allows you to launch shortcuts on your PC.  Unfortunately, due to differences in operating systems, it is difficult to open a browser reliably in Java.  Therefore, this application will not work on all operating systems or distributions.\r\n\r\nI plan on creating native installers for both Windows and Linux. In the meantime, I have a wiki page with manual installation instructions, which are unfortunately cumbersome and incomplete.\r\n\r\nI also intend on creating an application for converting shortcuts between the various types.\r\n\r\n### Known issues\r\n- The launcher does not work on some operating systems, for example Solaris.\r\n- The launcher only works on Linux distributions that have the \"xdg-open\" command installed.\r\n- The launcher does not appear to work on Windows with files with unicode characters (it gives\r\n  a \"file not found\" error).\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n- Latest JAR file: https://github.com/abcodeworks/LaunchWebShortcut-Java/releases/latest/\r\n- Installation wiki page: https://github.com/abcodeworks/LaunchWebShortcut-Java/wiki/Installing/\r\n- Source code: https://github.com/abcodeworks/LaunchWebShortcut-Java/\r\n\r\n## Android App\r\nAn Android app that allows you to launch and create shortcuts.\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n- Android Marketplace Page: http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.abcodeworks.webshortcutapp\r\n- Source code: https://github.com/abcodeworks/WebShortcut-Android/\r\n\r\n## Website\r\nI am working on a website that will allow you to launch or convert shortcuts using a web browser.  I will post a link here once it is ready.\r\n\r\n## Java Library\r\nA Java library intended for use in other Java applications.  It provides classes/methods for reading and writing shortcuts.  This library has been tested on Android and appears to be completely compatible. The functionality and implementation is largely equivalent to the Perl library.\r\n\r\nThe library is published to the Maven repository.  Use the following dependency:\r\n\r\n    <dependency>\r\n        <groupId>com.abcodeworks</groupId>\r\n        <artifactId>webshortcututil</artifactId>\r\n        <version>1.0.0</version>\r\n    </dependency>\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n- Latest JAR file: https://github.com/abcodeworks/WebShortcutUtil-Java/releases/latest/\r\n- JavaDocs:  http://abcodeworks.github.io/WebShortcutUtil-Java/javadoc/latest/\r\n- Maven Repository: http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.abcodeworks/webshortcututil\r\n- Source code: https://github.com/abcodeworks/WebShortcutUtil-Java/\r\n\r\n## Perl Library\r\nA Perl library that provides routines for reading and writing shortcuts.  The functionality and implementation is largely equivalent to the Java library.\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n- Source code: https://github.com/beckus/WebShortcutUtil-Perl/\r\n- CPAN module: http://search.cpan.org/~beckus/WebShortcutUtil/\r\n\r\n## Samples\r\nDuring development I collected shortcuts from various operating systems (both to study and to use for\r\nunit tests).  I also manually created some examples for testing purposes.  I made these available in their own repository with the hope that they will be useful to other developers.\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n- Repository: https://github.com/beckus/WebShortcutSamples/\r\n\r\n# Author\r\nAndre Beckus (@beckus)","google":"UA-50803151-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
